# Debugging GitHub Actions Cron Jobs

## Common Reasons Why GitHub Actions Cron Jobs Don't Fire

### 1. **Repository Activity Requirement**
GitHub Actions scheduled workflows require **repository activity** to run. If your repository has been inactive for 60+ days, scheduled workflows will be paused.

**Check this by:**
- Going to your repository's Actions tab
- Looking for any warning messages about inactive repositories
- Checking when the last commit/push was made

### 2. **Repository Visibility Issues**
- **Private repositories**: Cron jobs work normally
- **Public repositories**: Cron jobs work normally
- **Forked repositories**: Cron jobs may have limitations

### 3. **Cron Syntax Issues**
Your current cron syntax is correct: `'0,15,30,45 * * * *'`

### 4. **GitHub Actions Service Status**
Check if GitHub Actions is experiencing issues:
- Visit: https://www.githubstatus.com/
- Look for "GitHub Actions" service status

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Repository Activity
```bash
# Check when your last commit was
git log --oneline -1
```

### Step 2: Verify Workflow Files
Your workflow files look correct, but verify they're in the right branch:
- Ensure workflow files are in the `main` or `master` branch
- Check that the files are in `.github/workflows/` directory

### Step 3: Check GitHub Actions Settings
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" → "Actions" → "General"
3. Ensure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected
4. Check that "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" is enabled

### Step 4: Monitor Recent Runs
1. Go to your repository's "Actions" tab
2. Look for recent workflow runs
3. Check if there are any error messages or warnings

### Step 5: Test Manual Trigger
1. Go to your repository's "Actions" tab
2. Click on "Dutchie Inventory Cron (Fixed)"
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Verify it runs successfully

### Step 6: Check Next Scheduled Run
GitHub Actions cron jobs run based on UTC time. To check when the next run should be:

```bash
# Current UTC time
date -u

# Your cron schedule: 0,15,30,45 * * * *
# This means runs at:
# - XX:00 (top of every hour)
# - XX:15 (quarter past)
# - XX:30 (half past)
# - XX:45 (quarter to)
```

## Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Make a Small Commit
If your repository has been inactive, make a small commit to reactivate it:

```bash
# Add a small change to trigger repository activity
echo "# Last updated: $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README to trigger cron jobs"
git push
```

### Fix 2: Check Timezone
Ensure you're checking at the right times. GitHub Actions uses UTC:

```bash
# Convert your local time to UTC
# Example: If you're in EST (UTC-5), add 5 hours
# If you're in PST (UTC-8), add 8 hours
```

### Fix 3: Create a Test Workflow
Create a simple test workflow to verify cron is working:

```yaml
name: Simple Cron Test
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/5 * * * *'  # Every 5 minutes
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Test
        run: |
          echo "Cron test at $(date -u)"
          echo "Event: ${{ github.event_name }}"
```

## Expected Behavior

### When Cron Jobs Work:
- You should see workflow runs in the Actions tab every 15 minutes
- Runs should show "schedule" as the trigger
- Times should be at :00, :15, :30, :45 of every hour (UTC)

### When Cron Jobs Don't Work:
- No automatic runs appear in Actions tab
- Manual triggers still work
- You might see warnings about repository inactivity

## Next Steps

1. **Check repository activity** - Make sure you've had recent commits
2. **Verify timezone** - Remember GitHub Actions uses UTC
3. **Test manual trigger** - Ensure the workflow works when triggered manually
4. **Monitor for 24 hours** - Sometimes there can be delays in the first few runs

If the issue persists after trying these steps, the most likely cause is repository inactivity. Making a small commit should resolve it.

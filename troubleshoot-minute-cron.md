# Troubleshooting GitHub Actions Cron Jobs Not Firing Every Minute

## 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **1. Repository Activity Requirement**
**Issue**: GitHub Actions requires repository activity to run scheduled workflows
**Solution**: Make sure you have recent commits (within 60 days)

### **2. Branch Location**
**Issue**: Workflow files must be in the default branch (usually `main` or `master`)
**Solution**: Ensure your workflow is in `.github/workflows/` on the main branch

### **3. GitHub Actions Settings**
**Issue**: Actions might be disabled or restricted
**Solution**: Check repository settings → Actions → General

### **4. Timezone Confusion**
**Issue**: GitHub Actions uses UTC time
**Solution**: Remember that your local time might be different

## 🔧 **Step-by-Step Debugging**

### **Step 1: Verify Workflow Location**
```bash
# Check if workflow is in the right branch
git branch
git ls-files .github/workflows/
```

### **Step 2: Check Repository Activity**
```bash
# Check recent commits
git log --oneline -5
```

### **Step 3: Test Manual Trigger**
1. Go to GitHub → Actions tab
2. Click on your workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Verify it runs successfully

### **Step 4: Check GitHub Actions Status**
- Visit: https://www.githubstatus.com/
- Look for "GitHub Actions" service status

## 📋 **Quick Fixes to Try**

### **Fix 1: Make a Small Commit**
```bash
# Add a small change to trigger repository activity
echo "# Last updated: $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README to trigger cron jobs"
git push
```

### **Fix 2: Check Workflow Syntax**
Your cron syntax `'* * * * *'` is correct for every minute.

### **Fix 3: Verify File Permissions**
Ensure the workflow file has proper permissions and is committed.

## 🕐 **Timing Expectations**

- **Every minute** means runs at :00, :01, :02, :03, etc.
- **GitHub Actions uses UTC time**
- **There can be delays** of 1-5 minutes for scheduled runs
- **First run** might take longer to start

## 🔍 **What to Look For**

### **In GitHub Actions Tab:**
- ✅ Workflow runs appearing every minute
- ✅ "schedule" as the trigger (not "workflow_dispatch")
- ❌ No runs at all
- ❌ Only manual triggers working

### **Expected Behavior:**
- Runs should appear every minute
- Trigger should show "schedule"
- Times should be in UTC

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Check your Actions tab** for recent runs
2. **Try manual trigger** to ensure workflow works
3. **Wait 5-10 minutes** to see if scheduled runs appear
4. **Report back** what you see in the Actions tab

## 📞 **If Still Not Working**

If the issue persists:
1. Check GitHub Actions service status
2. Verify repository settings
3. Consider using a different schedule (like every 5 minutes)
4. Contact GitHub support if needed
